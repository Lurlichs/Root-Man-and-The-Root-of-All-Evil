# GlobalGameJam2023
This project is made during [Melbourne Global Game Jam 2023](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/jam-sites/melbourne-global-game-jam-2023) within 2 days with the theme of "Roots".
The game is a simple reverse-progression game where you play as an initially overpowered hero that loses his powers as he progresses. Beat up vegetables and progress your way to defeat the Root of all Evil!

## Game

### Reverse Progression

The character progresses backwards. You start with all of these powers, and for each stage you clear, you will lose a power of your choice, until the final stage, where you will facce the final boss... with only 1 power up!

The powers are as such:

* Health Regen
* Projectile Attack
* Double Jump
* Shield
* Special Area Attack

### Oversized Veggies

Fight through legions of evil vegetables. They will fiercely attack you with their different attack patterns!

Beware of the giant bosses as well...
